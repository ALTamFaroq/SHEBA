# Image processing package I have developed during my PhD work


The main idea here is to teat everything as a plugin. These are loaded as necessary. Which allows us to create a pipeline easily.
The next step was to create a GUI such that the user can create pipelines graphically and compile them on a specific problem. I used it in some of my applications and publications, I found it myself very helpful, I could not not maintain it since I have switched to python where it already has very nice packages, but for any Java application this can be helpful.

It has some examples on how to use and create a plugin, pipleline, or evern filters.
